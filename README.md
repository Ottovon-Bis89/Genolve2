# Genolve+: Genome Evolution Pathway Analysis
# Overview

Genolve+ (Genolve2) is a computational tool for reconstructing evolutionary pathways between closely related genomes. The software identifies and ranks the most biologically plausible sequences of genomic rearrangement events that transform a source genome into a target genome, providing insights into evolutionary history and genome dynamics.

# Description

Genolve+ implements an extended double-cut-and-join (DCJ) model [1] combined with a tree-searching algorithm to determine the minimum number of evolutionary events required to explain observed genomic differences. The tool identifies multiple types of genomic rearrangements including:

- Inversions: Reversal of DNA segment orientation
- Transpositions: Movement of DNA segments within chromosomes
- Translocations: Transfer of DNA segments between chromosomes (balanced and unbalanced)
- Insertions/Deletions: Addition or removal of DNA segments
- Duplications: Replication of DNA segments
- Fissions/Fusions : Chromosome breakage or joining events

The software uses synteny blocks generated by Mauve Aligner as input and returns all biologically acceptable transformation pathways with customizable event weighting.

# Features

- Identification of nine distinct types of genomic rearrangement events
- Multiple optimal pathway detection
- Customizable event cost weighting
- Foreign DNA fragment detection and handling
- Detailed output statistics including edit distance and event frequencies

# Requirements

- Python 3.8 and above
- Mauve Aligner(http://darlinglab.org/mauve/mauve.html) (for generating synteny blocks)

# Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ottovon-Bis89/Genolve2.git
cd Genolve2

# No additional installation required for Python modules
```

# Input Files

Genolve+ requires the following input files:

1. Source genome file (e.g., `FJSA.txt`): Synteny blocks representing the ancestral genome
2. Target genome file (e.g., `MTZ.txt`): Synteny blocks representing the derived genome
3. Weight ratios file** (e.g., `weight_ratios.txt`): Cost assignments for each rearrangement type
4. Foreign DNA fragments file (e.g., `frag.txt`): List of non-homologous DNA segments

# Input Format

Genome files: Each line represents a chromosome. Synteny blocks on the same chromosome are comma-separated. Blocks in reverse orientation are prefixed with a negative sign (-).

Example:
```
1,2,3,4,5
-6,7,8
9,10
```

Weight ratios file: Nine values representing costs for inversions, transpositions, balanced translocations, unbalanced translocations, fissions, fusions, insertions, deletions, and duplications (in that order).

# Usage

Step 1: Generate Foreign DNA Fragments

```bash
python3 ForeignDNA.py <source_genome.txt> <target_genome.txt> <output_fragments.txt> [--num_fragments N]
```

Example:
```bash
python3 ForeignDNA.py FJSA.txt MTZ.txt frag3.txt
```

This generates a file with 5 foreign DNA fragments (default value):
```
5_, 10_, 6_, 2_,9_

```

Step 2: Run Genolve+

```bash
python3 Genolve+.py -t <target_genome.txt> -s <source_genome.txt> -r <weight_ratios.txt> -f <fragments.txt> -o <output.txt>
```

Example:
```bash
python3 Genolve+.py -t MTZ.txt -s FJSA.txt -r weight_ratios.txt -f frag3.txt -o output.txt
```
